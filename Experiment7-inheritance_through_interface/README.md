# Experiment 7 : Multiple Inheritance in Java through Interfaces. 
 
 An interface in Java represents an abstract type; it is a collection of abstract methods and constants. All methods in an interface are abstract, and thus they have only signatures. All variables in an interface are implicitly final and static, and thus they are constants. 
A class can implement an interface by defining the methods in the interface. An interface cannot be instantiated. An interface cannot be used to derive a class, and a class cannot be used to derive an interface. An interface can be used to derive another interface (subinterface). 
 A class extends one class. 
 A class can implement many interfaces. 
 An interface can extented many interfaces.
